I'm a MSCS student @ Georgia Tech specializing in Machine Learning.

I am currently working under [Prof. Jason Zutty](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4pvykF8AAAAJ&hl=en) as Graduate Machine Learning Research Assistant at GTRI on a variety of computer vision models.

This past summer, I interned at Amazon (AWS), under [Adam Marrapode](), building a custom AD algorithm and system to root cause performance metric anomalies. In the distant past, I have also had the priviledge of interning at Zillow Group, advised by [Min Ji](), wherein I created a traffic reporting data pipeline.

I am aiming to pursue my PhD in provable deep learning to leverage a better understanding of neural representations for more efficient training and faster inference in foundation models. I am particularly interested in continual/lifelong learning in DL systems and enjoy experimenting with neuro-inspired alternatives to SGD for training. My interests span clustering in Transformer models, theoretical properties of stochastic gradient descent, high dimensional discrete tokenization, out-of-distribution performance, gradient flows, benign overfitting, and embodied AI.
