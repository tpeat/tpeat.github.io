I'm a MSCS student @ Georgia Tech specializing in Machine Learning.

I am a Graduate Machine Learning Research Assistant at [GTRI](https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/laboratories/electro-optical-systems-laboratory) working with [Prof. Jason Zutty](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4pvykF8AAAAJ&hl=en) on computer vision projects, focusing on distributed multi-stream object detection and tracking for survivability. Additionally, I'm completing my master's project under [Prof. Kartik Goyal](https://kartikgo.github.io/) researching dynamic compute methods to optimize LLM inference speed.

This past summer, I interned at Amazon (AWS) under [Adam Marrapode](), building a custom AD algorithm and system to root-cause performance metric anomalies. In the distant past, I have also had the privilege of interning at Zillow Group, advised by [Min Ji](), where I created a traffic reporting data pipeline.

I am aiming to pursue my PhD in provable deep learning to characterize the geometry and properties of learned representations to encourage trust and faster inference in foundation models. My interests span theoretical properties of Transformer models, optimal transport, high-dimensional discrete tokenization, out-of-distribution performance, gradient flows, benign overfitting, score-based models via Schr√∂dinger's bridge, and embodied AI.
