I'm a BSMS student at Georgia Tech working on computer vision and efficient AI research. During my undergrad, I have had the priviledge of working closely with [Prof. Jason Zutty](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4pvykF8AAAAJ&hl=en) at GTRI.

In the distant past, I have also had the priviledge of interning at Zillow Group, advised by [Min Ji](). 

On the side, I am particularly interested in making state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms. My goal is to fundamentally change the way we understand machine learning to increase efficiency, creativity in model architecture, and trustworthiness so models can be deployed in high consequence settings.
